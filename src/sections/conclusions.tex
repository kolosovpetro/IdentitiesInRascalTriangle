In this manuscript we have discussed new binomial identities in iterated rascal
triangles~\eqref{eq:odd-row-identity},~\eqref{prop:row-column-difference},~\eqref{prop:row-column-difference-general},
revealing a connection between the Vandermonde convolution formula and iterated rascal numbers.
We also present Vandermonde-like binomial identities~\eqref{prop:vandermonde-like-identity}.
Furthermore, we establish a relation between iterated rascal triangles
and $(1,q)$-binomial coefficients~\eqref{prop:row-column-difference-qbinomial}.
All the results can be validated using supplementary Mathematica scripts at~\cite{kolosov2024identities}.
