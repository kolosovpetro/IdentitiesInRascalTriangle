In this manuscript, we explore new binomial identities within iterated Rascal triangles,
revealing a connection between Vandermonde convolution and iterated Rascal numbers.
We also provide new identities in terms of finite differences of iterated Rascal numbers and Binomial coefficients.
Apart that, the manuscript provides a proof of the row sums conjecture in iterated Rascal triangles.
Also, we establish and explore a connection between iterated Rascal triangles and $(1,q)$-Binomial coefficients,
showing related OEIS sequences.
All result can be validated through the supplementary Mathematica programs.
