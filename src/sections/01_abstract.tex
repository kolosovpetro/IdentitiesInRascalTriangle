In this manuscript, we introduce new binomial identities in iterated Rascal triangles,
uncovering a connection between Vandermonde convolution and iterated Rascal numbers.
Additionally, we present novel identities involving the finite differences of iterated Rascal numbers
and binomial coefficients.
The manuscript also offers a proof of the row sums conjecture for iterated Rascal triangles.
Furthermore, we establish and explore the relationship between iterated Rascal triangles
and $(1,q)$-binomial coefficients, highlighting connections to relevant OEIS sequences.
All results are supported by supplementary Mathematica programs for validation.
