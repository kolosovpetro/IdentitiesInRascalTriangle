In 2010, three middle school students, Alif Anggoro, Eddy Liu, and Angus Tulloch~\cite{anggoro2010rascal},
were challenged to provide the next row for the number triangle shown below:
\[
    \begin{array}{cccccccc}
        &   &   &   & 1 &   &   &   \\
        &   &   & 1 &   & 1 &   &   \\
        &   & 1 &   & 2 &   & 1 &   \\
        & 1 &   & 3 &   & 3 &   & 1 \\
    \end{array}
\]

The expected answer that matches Pascal's triangle~\cite{sloane1994pascal} was ``1 4 6 4 1''.
However, Anggoro, Liu, and Tulloch suggested ``1 4 5 4 1'' instead.
They devised this new row via so-called diamond formula:
\begin{align*}
    \south  = \frac{\east \cdot \west + 1}{\north}
\end{align*}

So that upcoming rows of the triangle are
\input{figures/01_rascal_triangle_i_1}

Since then, a lot of work has been done over the topic of rascal triangles.
Numerous identities and relations have been revealed.
For instance, few combinatorial interpretations of rascal numbers provided at~\cite{gibbs2024two}, in particular,
these interpretations establish a relation between rascal numbers and combinatorics of binary words.
Few generalization approaches were proposed, namely generalized
and iterated rascal triangles~\cite{hotchkiss2019generalized,gregory2023iterated}.
In particular, the concept of iterated rascal numbers establishes a close connection between rascal numbers and binomial
coefficients.
