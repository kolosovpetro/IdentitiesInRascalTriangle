In this manuscript, we show new binomial identities in iterated rascal triangles,
revealing a connection between Vandermonde convolution and iterated rascal numbers.
We also present Vandermonde-like binomial identities.
Furthermore, we establish a relation between iterated rascal triangle and $(1,q)$-binomial coefficients.
